# Testnet Phase 2

## Overview
Phase 2 of the Powerloom testnet emphasizes user engagement in on-chain activities to assess the network's resilience. Participants are encouraged to interact with the network by signaling on-chain data, which is then captured by Powerloom Snapshotters. Users are rewarded for their involvement in various on-chain tasks designed.

## Key Activities
Participants engage in multiple on-chain activities on Mercle, a partner platform. These include bridging assets from Ethereum to Polygon zkEVM, swapping assets, and providing liquidity.

## Partnerships
For Phase 2, Powerloom collaborated with several partners:

1. Polygon zkEVM
2. Bungee Bridge
3. Owltoo
4. Quickswap
5. Safe

More details about our ecosystem partners are available [here](https://powerloom.io/ecosystem).

## Current Status
Phase 2 is actively ongoing and can be accessed on [Merkle](https://app.mercle.xyz/powerloom-phase2/events).

## Code Availability
The code for Phase 2 is publicly available on GitHub. For an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms, you can refer to the code [here](https://github.com/PowerLoom/deploy/tree/testnet_phase2).
