# Testnet Phase 1


## Overview of Phase 1

The inaugural phase of the Powerloom Incentivized Testnet was designed to engage and empower developers to experience the power of data with powerloom. This phase, dedicated to Snapshotters, was a critical step in validating and stress-testing our infrastructure. By enabling participants to set up and run snapshotter nodes, we aimed to create a robust, composable data ecosystem tailored for the needs of the Web3 community.

## Role and Functionality of Snapshotters

Snapshotters played a crucial role in this phase. These nodes were responsible for capturing and snapshotting the data, specifically on UniswapV2. This included data such as top token pairs, tokens based on liquidity pool dynamics, Fees and volume in the 24Hrs and 7 days range. By snapshotting this data, Snapshotters contributed to creating a comprehensive, decentralized repository of DeFi market information.

## Phase 1 Conclusion
Concluding in October 2023, Phase 1 received great response from the community, marking a successful first step in Powerloom's journey.
