# Testnet Phase 1

## Overview and Insights

The first phase of the Powerloom Incentivized Testnet was designed to engage and empower developers to experience the power of data with powerloom. This phase, dedicated to Snapshotters, was a critical step in validating and stress-testing our infrastructure. By enabling participants to set up and run snapshotter nodes, we aimed to create a robust, composable data ecosystem tailored for the needs of the Web3 community.

## The Role and Impact of Snapshotters

Snapshotters played a crucial role in this phase. These nodes were responsible for capturing and snapshotting the data, specifically on UniswapV2. This included data such as 
- top token pairs
-  tokens based on liquidity pool dynamics
-  Fees and volume in the 24Hrs and 7 days range. 

By snapshotting this data, Snapshotters contributed to creating a comprehensive, decentralized repository of DeFi Data market information.

An integral part of this testnet phase was the [UniswapV2 Dashboard](https://uniswapv2.powerloom.io), which displayed the data collated by the Snapshotters.

Additionally, Phase 1 included a consensus dashboard, enabling users to verify the submission status of their snapshots.
