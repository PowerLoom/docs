# Lite Node Phase

We are thrilled to announce that Early Mint for our Snapshotter Lite Node is live! This is an opportunity for everyone to participate in our Composable Data Network. You can now mint up to 10 slots and run your Snapshotter Lite Nodes.

Our pre-mint successfully concluded on February 4th, 2024.
For more details, please visit our blog post: [First Data Infrastructure Mint on Polygon](https://blog.powerloom.io/first-data-infrastructure-mint-on-polygon-launching-over-10-000-data-nodes/).

Important Announcement: Our Testnet is gearing up for launch shortly. In the interim, we invite developers to experiment with running our Snapshotter node.

While currently operating the node does not yield rewards, this is an excellent opportunity to simulate and test the Snapshotter node, providing valuable insights into its functionality and operation.

## Introducing Snapshotter Lite Nodes

After acquiring node slots, you can operate our Snapshotter Lite Node. This version is more streamlined than the full Snapshotter Node, requiring only a Python environment and considerably fewer resources. It's ideal for simpler scenarios that don't need data aggregation.

## How Snapshotter Lite Node Functions within the PowerLoom Ecosystem

The architecture of the Snapshotter Lite Node primarily differs from the full node implementation mainly because it reduces the overhead of messaging queues and streamlines other complex components. This is essential for contributing to data markets, beginning with the UniswapV2 Data Markets.

 By snapshotting data, your node contributes to the underlying data in populating the UniswapV2 Dashboard. Learn more about its architecture [here](https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-lite?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

## Node Minting Process

Minting a slot is straightforward. Follow our [Node Mint Guide](https://www.notion.so/Node-Slot-NFT-Mints-1a5e4f4de0164a1e877e233ea61fbd1f?pvs=21) for step-by-step instructions.

## Hardware requirements:

Hardware requirements for running the node can be found in the [getting started](../build-with-powerloom/snapshotter-node/lite-node/getting-started/#hardware-requirements) section of the lite node.

## Running the Node

Setting up Snapshotter Lite Nodes is user-friendly. Our detailed documentation will guide you through the process. Get started [here](../build-with-powerloom/snapshotter-node/lite-node/getting-started/).

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

If you are encountering issues while running the node, you can refer to our monitoring documentation for insights on tracking and troubleshooting.
