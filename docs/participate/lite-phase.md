# Lite Node Phase

We are excited to announce the launch of the public Mint for our Snapshotter Lite Node, now live and open to all! This marks a significant milestone in our Composable Data Network, offering everyone the chance to mint up to 10 slots and operate their own Snapshotter Lite Nodes.

### Key Milestones in Our Node Mint Journey:
- ✅ Pre-Mint Kickoff: January 25th, 2024
- ✅ Pre-Mint Closure: February 4th, 2024
- ✅ Pre-Mint Selection: February 6th, 2024
- ✅ Early Mint (Exclusive): February 7th, 2024 (ongoing)
- ⏳ Public Mint Opens: February 9th, 2024

We're proud to share that our early mint concluded successfully on February 9th, 2024, with over 1700 slots minted.

For detailed information, please refer to our Snapshotter Node Mint documentation: [Snapshotter Node Mint Documentation](https://powerloom.network/mint-docs/)

:::info Important Announcement
 As we prepare for our Testnet launch, we invite developers to explore and experiment with operating our Snapshotter node. Currently, operating the node does not provide rewards, but it offers a valuable opportunity to simulate, test, and gain insights into the Snapshotter node's functionality and operation.

## What Are Snapshotter Lite Nodes?

Once you have acquired your node slots, you can begin operating our Snapshotter Lite Node. This streamlined version of the full Snapshotter Node requires only a Python environment and significantly fewer resources, making it ideal for less complex scenarios that do not require data aggregation.

## Role of the Snapshotter Lite Node in the PowerLoom Ecosystem

The Snapshotter Lite Node's architecture is distinct from the full node version, mainly by reducing messaging queue overheads and simplifying other complex components. This streamlined design is crucial for contributing to data markets, starting with the [UniswapV2 Data Markets](https://uniswapv2.powerloom.io).

Your node plays a vital role by snapshotting data, thus contributing to the data pool used in the UniswapV2 Dashboard. To understand more about its architecture, visit [Snapshotter Lite Node Overview](https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-lite?tab=readme-ov-file#overview).

## The Node Minting Process

Minting a slot is a simple process. Follow our comprehensive [Node Mint Guide](https://www.notion.so/Node-Slot-NFT-Mints-1a5e4f4de0164a1e877e233ea61fbd1f?pvs=21) for step-by-step instructions.

## Hardware Requirements

Find the necessary hardware specifications for running the node in the [Getting Started](../build-with-powerloom/snapshotter-node/lite-node/getting-started/#hardware-requirements) section of our lite node documentation.

## Setting Up Your Node

Our documentation provides a user-friendly guide for setting up Snapshotter Lite Nodes. Begin your setup journey [here](../build-with-powerloom/snapshotter-node/lite-node/getting-started/).

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while operating your node, our monitoring documentation offers valuable insights for tracking and troubleshooting.
