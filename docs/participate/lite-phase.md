## Setting up your Snapshotter LiteNode
:::note
Since the lite node testnet ended a while ago, and we have V2 of the lite node protocol running on mainnet, we recommend you to follow the [Getting Started](/docs/build-with-powerloom/snapshotter-node/lite-node-v2/getting-started.md) guide for setting up your snapshotter lite node.
