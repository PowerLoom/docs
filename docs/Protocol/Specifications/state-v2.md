# Protocol State: V2

## Overview: Smart Contract Architecture

The smart contracts that maintain the state of the protocol V2 interact are arranged as depicted in the diagram that follows.

This architecture is an upgrade from the protocol state of V1 in the following aspects:

### Unified view and interface for all peers

The implementation of the protocol state in V2 introduces a unified view and interface for all peers on the network, with the ability to extend functionality with new features as the protocol evolves.

All the interactions with underlying data markets, their state changes and event emissions are accessible through the implementation of the protocol state core.


### Protocol State Core
* The core of the protocol state is now maintained in a separate contract, managed by an ERC1967Proxy upgradeable proxy
* The upgradable proxy pattern allows for the core state contract to be upgraded without the need to redeploy the proxy and all the dependent contracts
* The upgradable proxy pattern also allows for the core state contract to be upgraded in a controlled manner, with the ability to maintain previous versions of the contract in case a regression is introduced in the new version

#### Functions

##### `initialize(address initialOwner, address _snapshotterState, address _dataMarketFactory)`

Initializes the contract with the owner, snapshotter state, and data market factory addresses.

```solidity
function initialize(
    address initialOwner,
    address _snapshotterState,
    address _dataMarketFactory
) initializer public
```

##### `receive()`

Allows the contract to receive Ether.

```solidity
receive() external payable {}
```

##### `updateDataMarketFactory(address _address)`

Updates the address of the data market factory.

```solidity
function updateDataMarketFactory(address _address) external onlyOwner
```

##### `updateSnapshotterState(address _address)`

Updates the address of the snapshotter state contract.

```solidity
function updateSnapshotterState(address _address) external onlyOwner
```

##### `getSlotRewards(uint256 slotId)`

Retrieves the rewards for a given slot.

```solidity
function getSlotRewards(uint256 slotId) public view returns (uint256 rewards)
```

##### `toggleDataMarket(address dataMarketAddress, bool enabled)`

Toggles the enabled status of a data market.

```solidity
function toggleDataMarket(address dataMarketAddress, bool enabled) public onlyOwner
```

##### `getTotalNodeCount()`

Gets the total count of nodes.

```solidity
function getTotalNodeCount() public view returns(uint256)
```

##### `enabledNodeCount()`

Gets the current count of enabled nodes.

```solidity
function enabledNodeCount() external view returns (uint256)
```

##### `claimRewards(address _user)`

Allows a user to claim their accumulated rewards.

```solidity
function claimRewards(address _user) external
```

##### `emergencyWithdraw()`

Allows the owner to withdraw all funds from the contract in case of emergency.

```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw() public onlyOwner
```

### Data markets

Data market contracts are now separated from the protocol state core. Their creation is initiated from the protocol state core contract and intermediated by a data market factory contract.

The following features of the protocol state are now maintained in the data market contract since they are specific to their operations and functions:

* Epochs
  * Epoch release and epoch size
  * Epochs in a "day"
* Allowed sequencer identities
* Finalized snapshot CIDs against project IDs
* Submission counts against snapshotter slots
* Submission batches and their attestation consensus by validators

* [State view: Data market contracts](#state-view-data-market-contracts)
* [Sequencer](/Protocol/Protocol_v2/sequencer.md)
* [Validator](/Protocol/Protocol_v2/validator.md)
* [Data market](/Protocol/data-sources.md)
* [Snapshot composition](/Protocol/data-composition.md)
:::

### User Information

```solidity
struct UserInfo {
    uint256 totalRewards;
    uint256 totalClaimed;
    uint256 lastClaimed;
    uint256 lastUpdated;
}
```

### State Variables

* `slotRewards`: Mapping from slot ID to rewards.
* `dataMarketCount`: Total number of data markets created.
* `dataMarketIdToAddress`: Mapping from data market ID to its address.
* `dataMarkets`: Mapping from data market address to its information.
* `userInfo`: Mapping from user address to their reward information.

### Identity management

#### Snapshotters

Snapshotters are assigned nodes on the protocol, and their identities are maintained on a separate `PowerloomNodes` contract. The interface to interact with this contract is maintained in the protocol state core contract as well as the data market contracts.

```solidity
/**
 * @title IPowerloomNodes
 * @dev Interface for the PowerloomNodes contract
 */
interface IPowerloomNodes {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the snapshotter address for a given node
     * @param nodeId The ID of the node
     * @return address of the snapshotter
     */
    function nodeSnapshotterMapping(uint256 nodeId) external view returns (address);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the total number of nodes
     * @return uint256 representing the total snapshotter count
     */
    function getTotalSnapshotterCount() external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev Checks if an address is a registered snapshotter
     * @param snapshotter Address to check
     * @return bool indicating if the address is a snapshotter
     */
    function allSnapshotters(address snapshotter) external view returns (bool);

    /**
     * @dev Checks if a node is available
     * @param _nodeId The ID of the node to check
     * @return bool indicating if the node is available
     */
    function isNodeAvailable(uint256 _nodeId) external view returns (bool);
}
```

### Comparisons with V1

#### New features
In an upgrade to V1, the protocol state in V2 introduces the following:

* Batched snapshot submissions from sequencer
* Attestation on submission batches from validators

:::info
The upgraded architecture of the protocol state allows for support of feature extensions in existing categories of peers like snapshotters and sequencers, along with introducing new categories of peers like validators, watchers among others.
:::

#### Removed features

* [Method to directly accept submissions from allowed snapshotters](/Protocol/Specifications/state-v1.md#function-submitsnapshotstring-memory-snapshotcid-uint256-epochid-string-memory-projectid-request-calldata-request-bytes-calldata-signature-public)
* Snapshot submissions as content identifiers(CIDs) per epoch
* Occurrence count of their submissions
* Mapping between allowed snapshotter identities and the CIDs they submitted
* Time slot allotted to snapshotter identities: `timeSlotPreference(uint256)`
* Indication of whether a snapshot was received against a slot ID within an epoch ID: `snapshotsReceivedSlot`

#### Inherited, continued features

:::note
Most of the [V1 protocol state](/Protocol/Specifications/state-v1.md) implemented for the different phases of the incentivized testnets and the lite node testnet continues in V2.
:::

* Slot based snapshotter identities (slot IDs)
* Snapshot CIDs per epoch per project with the max occurrence frequency
* Time slots allotted to slot IDs against snapshotter identities

## Deployed contracts

The contract addresses for the V2 protocol state can be found in the `env.example` file for the type of node being deployed. Refer to the specific node's repository for the most up-to-date deployment information.

---

## State transitions

### Snapshot state

```solidity
enum SnapshotStatus {
    PENDING,
    FINALIZED
}
```
The state of a snapshot CID against a project ID is `PENDING` when reported by the sequencer and `FINALIZED` when the same is attested to by the validator.

The `PENDING` state can be considered to be an intermediate, trusted state since it is reported by the sequencer which has no incentive to be a bad actor unless its security is compromised.

---

## State modification: Data market contracts

### Update 'day' size

```solidity
function updateDaySize(uint256 _daySize, address _sender) public onlyProtocolState {
    DAY_SIZE = _daySize;
    epochsInADay = DAY_SIZE / (SOURCE_CHAIN_BLOCK_TIME * EPOCH_SIZE);
}
```

A 'day' for a data market is defined by the `DAY_SIZE` in seconds. The `epochsInADay` is the number of epochs that fit into a day.

### Rewards distribution

#### Toggle rewards distribution

```solidity
function toggleRewards(address _sender) public onlyProtocolState {
    rewardsEnabled = !rewardsEnabled;
}
```

#### Daily snapshot quota

This quota is the number of snapshots that have to be submitted by a snapshotter in a day to be eligible for rewards.

```solidity
function updateDailySnapshotQuota(
    uint256 _dailySnapshotQuota, address _sender
) public onlyProtocolState {
    dailySnapshotQuota = _dailySnapshotQuota;
}
```

#### Update Reward Pool Size

```solidity
function updateRewardPoolSize(
    uint256 newRewardPoolSize, address _sender
) public onlyProtocolState {
    rewardPoolSize = newRewardPoolSize;
}
```

#### Commit submission counts

The sequencer commits the submission counts for a day against the slot IDs of the snapshotters. It is planned to be decentralized in the future by combining the election of sequencers and reports on submitted counts peers called 'watchers'.

```solidity
function updateRewards(uint256 slotId, uint256 submissions, uint256 day, address _sender) public onlyProtocolState returns (bool) {
```

:::note
Many functions in `PowerloomDataMarket` are called internally by `PowerloomProtocolState`. When called via `PowerloomProtocolState`, the `msg.sender` of the `PowerloomProtocolState` call is passed as the `_sender` parameter to the `PowerloomDataMarket` function.
:::

Refer: [day size for a data market](#update-day-size)

#### Update Eligible Nodes for Day

```solidity
function updateEligibleNodesForDay(uint256 day, uint256 eligibleNodes, address _sender) public onlyProtocolState {
```

### Epochs

#### Epoch release

```solidity
function releaseEpoch(
    uint256 begin,
    uint256 end,
    address _sender
) public isActive onlyProtocolState returns (bool, bool) {
```

Refer: [Epoch manager](/Protocol/Specifications/Epoch.md)

#### Skip epochs

```solidity
function forceSkipEpoch(
    uint256 begin,
    uint256 end,
    address _sender
) public onlyOwnerOrigin isActive {
```

This is a fallback mechanism to skip epochs in case the epoch release service fails.

### Snapshot submission in batches by [sequencer](/Protocol/Protocol_v2/sequencer.md)

```solidity
function submitSubmissionBatch(
        string memory batchCid,
        uint256 epochId,
        string[] memory projectIds,
        string[] memory snapshotCids,
        bytes32 finalizedCidsRootHash,
        address _sender
    ) public onlyProtocolState
```

An epoch as identified by `epochId` can contain multiple batches of snapshot submissions from the sequencer, as referenced by the `batchCid`.

The entire contents of this batch are made available on IPFS on the CID `batchCid`.

The elements of the arrays `projectIds` and `snapshotCids` are present as a 1:1 mapping that the sequencer reports as finalized CID against each of the project IDs.

:::note
* The `projectIds` and `snapshotCids` arrays are expected to be of the same length.
* In the next upgrade, the `projectIds` and `snapshotCids` arrays will be removed. The `finalizedCidsRootHash`, that is the root hash of the merkle tree built from the CIDs of the projects, holds appropriate information to be used in the consensus rule for attestation as well as verification of the batch CID uploaded to IPFS and anchored to the protocol state by this function call.
:::

### Indicating end of batch submissions for an epoch

```solidity
function endBatchSubmissions(uint256 epochId, address _sender) external {
```

### Attestation against submission batches by [validator](/Protocol/Protocol_v2/validator.md)

```solidity
function submitBatchAttestation(
        string memory batchCid,
        uint256 epochId,
        bytes32 finalizedCidsRootHash,
        address _sender
    ) public onlyProtocolState
```

Validators submit their attestations against batches of snapshot submissions in an `epochId` by refererring to their `batchCid`.

The attestation is the `finalizedCidsRootHash` which is the hash of the merkle tree root constructed from the finalized CIDs across the projects contained in a batch.

### Finalization against attestation consensus

`shouldFinalizeBatchAttestation()` is used as the state check whether the consensus rule around attestations submitted by the network of validators is satisfied, followed by a call to `finalizeSnapshotBatch()` that finalizes the snapshot CIDs against the project IDs contained in a `batchCid` for an `epochId`.

```solidity
function shouldFinalizeBatchAttestation(
    string memory batchCid,
    uint256 currentAttestationCount
) private view returns (bool) {
```

```solidity
function finalizeSnapshotBatch(string memory batchCid, uint256 epochId) private
```

### Triggering attestation consensus externally

```solidity
function forceCompleteConsensusAttestations(
  string memory batchCid, 
  uint256 epochId,
  address _sender
) public onlyProtocolState returns (bool TRIGGER_BATCH_RESUBMISSION, bool BATCH_FINALIZED) {
```

---

## State view: Data market contracts

### Epoch size

```solidity
uint8 public EPOCH_SIZE; // Number of Blocks in each Epoch
```

Refer: [Epoch](/Protocol/Specifications/Epoch.md)
### Data source chain properties

These properties are specific to the chain on which the actual data sources i.e. smart contracts and applications are running.

```solidity
uint256 public SOURCE_CHAIN_ID;
uint256 public SOURCE_CHAIN_BLOCK_TIME; // Block time in seconds * 1e4 (to allow decimals)
```

### Consensus properties

uint256 public batchSubmissionWindow // Number of blocks to wait before finalizing batch
uint256 public attestationSubmissionWindow // Number of blocks to wait for attestation acceptance
uint256 public minAttestationsForConsensus // Minimum number of attestations for consensus
```

### Status and CIDs of snapshots

* The snapshot CID reported to have reached consensus against a `projectId` for an `epochId`. The `ConsensusStatus` wraps the [`SnapshotStatus` enum](#snapshot-state).

```solidity
mapping(string projectId => mapping(
  uint256 epochId => ConsensusStatus
)) public snapshotStatus;

function maxSnapshotsCid(
    string memory projectId,
    uint256 epochId
) public view returns (string memory, SnapshotStatus) {
```

* Snapshot CID finalized for a project ID against an epoch ID, as reported by the sequencer.

```solidity
mapping(string projectId => uint256 epochId) public lastSequencerFinalizedSnapshot;
```

* Snapshot CID finalized against an epoch ID for each project ID, once validators attest to the finalization from sequencer as shown above.

```solidity
mapping(string projectId => uint256 epochId) public lastFinalizedSnapshot;
```

* The very first epoch ID against which a finalization was achieved for a project ID.

```solidity
mapping(string projectId => uint256 epochId) public projectFirstEpochId;
```

### `batchCidToProjects`

```solidity
mapping(string batchCid => string[] projectids) public batchCidToProjects;
```

Project IDs contained within a Batch CID.

### `epochIdToBatchCids`

```solidity
mapping(uint256 epochId => string[] batchCids) public epochIdToBatchCids;
```

Batch CIDs of submissions sent out for an epoch by the sequencer.

### Validator attestations

```solidity
mapping(string batchCid => mapping(address => bool)) public attestationsReceived;
mapping(string batchCid => mapping(bytes32 finalizedCidsRootHash=> uint256 count)) public attestationsReceivedCount;
mapping(string batchCid => uint256 count) public maxAttestationsCount;
mapping(string batchCid => bytes32 finalizedCidsRootHash) public maxAttestationFinalizedRootHash;
mapping(string batchCid => bool) public batchCidAttestationStatus;
```

Storing attestations received from validator identities and their counts of attestations against finalized root hashes of merkle trees built from CIDs.

```solidity
mapping(string batchCid => bytes32 finalizedCidsRootHash) public batchCidSequencerAttestation;
mapping(string batchCid => address[] validators) public batchCidDivergentValidators;
```

State of the initial attestation as reported by the sequencer as finalized CIDs against the project IDs and the state of them if they diverge from the consensus on attestations as reached by validators.

## Events

### Namespaced event emissions

Event emissions specific to data market operations are emitted from the data market contracts as well as the protocol state core contract, which has an additional topic that identifies the data market against which the operation is being performed.

This allows for state and event observers on the protocol to filter events by the data market contract of interest.

For example, the `SnapshotBatchSubmitted` event has the following signatures when emitted from:
