# Data markets

Snapshotters generate snapshots, base as well as higher order, composable snapshots according to the data sources defined by the data markets they participate in. Every data market maintains its [specific protocol state](/docs/Protocol/Specifications/protocol_state.md) regarding submission, calculation and finalization of such snapshots.

The data sources defined by a market can be static as well as dynamic, depending on the use case at hand.
