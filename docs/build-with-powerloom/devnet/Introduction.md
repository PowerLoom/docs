# Introduction to Devnet


:::success info
#### Our Devnet is live!
Get access to the Devnet and build exciting data applications, you can mint a no-cost NFT slot on the Sepolia network. Devnet mint page: https://devnet-mint.powerloom.dev
:::

Our Devnet provides developers with a sandbox environment to build and test data-driven applications. By leveraging Powerloom's structured and easily accessible data, developers can create powerful tools such as dashboards, arbitrage bots, and wallet trackers. The Devnet allows for experimentation and iteration without the risks associated with using real assets on a live network.

Start building data application with Powerloom by setting up your own Snapshotter node on our devnet.
Our Devnet environment is designed to facilitate developers in:
- expanding upon [our pre-existing use cases](../use-cases/existing-implementations/)
- innovating [new applications](../use-cases/building-new-usecase/)
