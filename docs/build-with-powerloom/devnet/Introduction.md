# Introduction to Devnet

Devnet provides developers with a sandbox environment to build and test data-driven applications. Developers can create powerful tools such as dashboards, arbitrage bots, and wallet trackers. The Devnet allows for experimentation and iteration without the risks associated with using real assets on a live network.

Start building data application with Powerloom by setting up your own Snapshotter node on our devnet.
Our Devnet environment is designed to facilitate developers in:
- expanding upon [our pre-existing use cases](../../category/existing-implementations)
- innovating [new applications](../../category/building-a-new-use-case)

### Data Source Chains

We currently support data collection from the Ethereum for our existing datamarkets, [Uniswap V2](../category/uniswap-dashboard) and [Aave V3](../category/aavev3-dashboard)

| Chain           | Data Markets        |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Ethereum Mainnet| Uniswap V2, Aave V3 |

### Powerloom Devnet Chain
- **Chain**: Testnet chain powered by [Conduit](https://hub.conduit.xyz/prost1j-emrlsr8nrc) 
- **Faucet**: Powerloom testnet tokens available at [faucet.powerloom.dev](https://faucet.powerloom.dev)

If you want to request support for any other data source chains, please ask us on #developers channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/powerloom).

## Next Steps
To begin building your applications, head over to the [getting started](./getting-started.md) section to mint your Powerloom node and snapshotting either of the data markets.
