# Introduction to Devnet


:::success info
#### Our Devnet is undergoing an upgrade!
⌛️ We will announce on socials and update this page once it's ready
:::

Devnet provides developers with a sandbox environment to build and test data-driven applications. Developers can create powerful tools such as dashboards, arbitrage bots, and wallet trackers. The Devnet allows for experimentation and iteration without the risks associated with using real assets on a live network.

Start building data application with Powerloom by setting up your own Snapshotter node on our devnet.
Our Devnet environment is designed to facilitate developers in:
- expanding upon [our pre-existing use cases](../../category/existing-implementations)
- innovating [new applications](../../category/building-a-new-use-case)

## Chains Supported

We currently support the following chains (Mainnet and Testnet). If you want to request support for any other chains, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/PowerLoom/deploy/issues). 

| Chain    | Mainnet | Testnet |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Ethereum | ✓       |         |
| Sepolia  |         | ✓       |
