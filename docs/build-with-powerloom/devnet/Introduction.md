# Introduction to Devnet

Devnet provides developers with a sandbox environment to build and test data-driven applications. Developers can create powerful tools such as dashboards, arbitrage bots, and wallet trackers. The Devnet allows for experimentation and iteration without the risks associated with using real assets on a live network.

:::tip Zero-Cost Testing Environment
Devnet is a complete replica of our mainnet functionality running on our testnet chain. Get started immediately with free tokens from our faucet - no gas fees or financial commitment required!
:::

Start building data application with Powerloom by setting up your own Snapshotter node on our devnet. For a comprehensive understanding of the Powerloom Protocol and snapshotter architecture, see our [mainnet snapshotter introduction](../snapshotter-node/introduction.md).

Our Devnet environment is designed to facilitate developers in:
- Testing and understanding [how snapshotters work](../snapshotter-node/introduction.md) without any costs
- Expanding upon [our pre-existing use cases](../../category/existing-implementations) like Uniswap V2 and Aave V3 dashboards
- Innovating [new applications](../../category/building-a-new-use-case) with custom data compositions
- Learning the protocol before deploying on [mainnet](../snapshotter-node/lite-node-v2/getting-started.md)

### Data Source Chains

We currently support data collection from the Ethereum for our existing datamarkets, [Uniswap V2](../use-cases/existing-implementations/uniswap-dashboard/index.md) and [Aave V3](../use-cases/existing-implementations/aavev3-dashboard/index.md)

| Chain           | Data Markets        |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Ethereum Mainnet| Uniswap V2, Aave V3 |

### Powerloom Devnet Chain
- **Chain**: Testnet chain powered by [Conduit](https://hub.conduit.xyz/prost1j-emrlsr8nrc) 
- **Faucet**: Powerloom testnet tokens available at [devnet-faucet.powerloom.dev](https://devnet-faucet.powerloom.dev)

### Getting Started Quickly
1. **Get free tokens**: Visit [devnet-faucet.powerloom.dev](https://devnet-faucet.powerloom.dev) 
2. **Mint your slot**: Head to [devnet-mint.powerloom.dev](https://devnet-mint.powerloom.dev)
3. **Start snapshotting**: Follow our [setup guide](./getting-started.md)

The entire process takes less than 10 minutes!

If you want to request support for any other data source chains, please ask us on [#developers](https://discord.com/channels/777248105636560948/1180479966434054165) channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/powerloom).

## Next Steps
To begin building your applications, head over to the [getting started](./getting-started.md) section to mint your Powerloom node and snapshotting either of the data markets.
