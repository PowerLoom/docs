# Introduction to Devnet

Devnet provides developers with a sandbox environment to build and test data-driven applications. Developers can create powerful tools such as dashboards, arbitrage bots, and wallet trackers. The Devnet allows for experimentation and iteration without the risks associated with using real assets on a live network.

Start building data application with Powerloom by setting up your own Snapshotter node on our devnet.
Our Devnet environment is designed to facilitate developers in:
- expanding upon [our pre-existing use cases](../../category/existing-implementations)
- innovating [new applications](../../category/building-a-new-use-case)

## Chains Supported

The Powerloom Devnet operates on its own dedicated blockchain, eliminating the need for external testnet tokens. 

### Data Source Chains
We currently support data collection from the following chains:

| Chain    | Network Type |
|----------|--------------|
| Ethereum | Mainnet      |

### Powerloom Devnet Chain
- **Chain**: Powerloom Devnet
- **Faucet**: Available at [faucet.powerloom.dev](https://faucet.powerloom.dev)
- **No external tokens required**: The devnet uses its own chain, so you don't need Sepolia ETH or other testnet tokens

If you want to request support for any other data source chains, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/PowerLoom/deploy/issues).
