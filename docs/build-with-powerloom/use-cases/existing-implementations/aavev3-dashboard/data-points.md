# Datapoints

![AaveV3 Dashboard Powerloom](/images/aavev3-dashboard-powerloom.png)

In Aave V3-Pooler, data points are specific, quantifiable elements derived from Aave V3 lending activities. 
Each snapshot inherits `SnapshotBase` which looks something like this:
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/6fb98b1bbc22be8b5aba8bdc860004d35786f4df/utils/models/message_models.py#L9-L17
```

## Base Snapshots

The following type of Base Snapshots are generated for the Aave V3 dashboard:

### 1. Asset Metrics Snapshot

The Asset Metrics refer to the total supplied and borrowed amounts, supply and borrow interest rates, and the indices used to compute future rate changes. 
The asset snapshot looks something like this:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/message_models.py#L26-L42
```
#### 1a. AaveSupplyData / AaveDebtData

The nominal token amount and the token amount in terms of USD at the time of snapshotting:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/data_models.py#L65-L72
```
#### 1b. AssetDetailsData

Additional asset details include the maximum loan-to-value ratio, liquidation information, the asset's reserve factor, borrow/supply caps, and available eMode options.

For further information, please see the Aave V3 Protocol [Documentation](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters).

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/data_models.py#L25-L34
```

#### 1c. RateDetailsData

Additional rate details describing the interest rate strategy for the asset.

For further information, please see the Aave V3 Protocol [Documentation](https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate).

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/data_models.py#L37-L45
```

### 2. Volume-by-Action Snapshot

The asset's total volume-by-action for the Epoch, and the corresponding events for each action emitted by the blockchain. 
The volume-by-action snapshot looks something like this:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/message_models.py#L91-L98
```

#### 2a. volumeData

The total nominal token volume and the volume in terms of USD at the time of snapshotting:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/data_models.py#L92-L94
```

#### 2b. liquidationData

Additional details describing a liquidation action:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/data_models.py#L117-L122
```

## Aggregate Snapshots

The above base snapshots are used as the data source for higher-order aggregates. These aggregates are then used to generate the data points present on the Aave V3 Dashboard. Refer to [data-composition](/Protocol/data-composition) for more details on how data points are composed.

The following aggregate snapshots are generated by AaveV3-Pooler using base snapshots:

### 1. Top Assets by Marketshare Snapshot

All assets are organized by the total market share on the protocol. The top assets by marketshare snapshot look something like this:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/message_models.py#L55-L69
```

### 2. 24 Hour Volume-by-Action Snapshot

24-hour volume-by-action for each asset per Epoch. The 24-hour volume-by-action snapshot looks something like this:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/message_models.py#L101-L107
```

### 3. Top Assets by Volume Snapshot

All assets are organized by their 24-hour total volume-by-action. The top assets by volume snapshot looks something like this:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/message_models.py#L110-L128
```

### 4. 6 Hour Average Rates Snapshot

Average supply and borrow rates over the previous 6 hours for each asset per Epoch. The 6-hour average rate snapshot looks something like this:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/message_models.py#L82-L88
```

### 5. 24 Hour Total Market Stats Snapshot

24-hour stats for the entire Aave lending market. The 24-hour stats snapshot looks something like this:

```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/aave/utils/models/message_models.py#L72-L79
```
