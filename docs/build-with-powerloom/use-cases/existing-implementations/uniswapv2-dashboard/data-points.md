# Datapoints

![UniswapV2 Dashboard Powerloom](/images/uniswapv2-dashboard-powerloom.png)

In Pooler, data points are specific, quantifiable elements derived from Uniswap V2 trading activities. 
Each snapshot inherits `Snapshot Base` which looks something like this
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/6fb98b1bbc22be8b5aba8bdc860004d35786f4df/utils/models/message_models.py#L9-L17
```

The following type of Base Snapshots are generated by Pooler for Uniswap V2 Dashboard

**1. Pair Reserves Snapshot:** Liquidity reserves of each pair per Epoch. The reserves snapshot looks something like this
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/6fb98b1bbc22be8b5aba8bdc860004d35786f4df/utils/models/message_models.py#L20-L32
```
**2. Trade Volume Snapshot:** Trade volume of each pair per Epoch. The trade volume snapshot looks something like this
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/6fb98b1bbc22be8b5aba8bdc860004d35786f4df/utils/models/message_models.py#L40-L54

```

These base snapshots are then used to generate higher order aggregates. These aggregates are then used to generate the data points that are used in the Uniswap V2 Dashboard. Refer to [data-composition](/docs/protocol/data-composition) for more details on how data points are composed.

Following aggregate snapshots are generated by Pooler using base snapshots.

**1. 24 Hour Trade Volume Snapshot:** 24 hour trade volume of each pair per Epoch. The 24 hour trade volume snapshot looks something like this
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/6fb98b1bbc22be8b5aba8bdc860004d35786f4df/utils/models/message_models.py#L57-L64
```

**2. 7 days Trade Volume Snapshot:** 7 days trade volume of each pair per Epoch. The 7 days trade volume snapshot exactly like 24 hour trade volume snapshot but with a different time window. 

**3. 24 hours Top Pairs Snapshot:** Top pairs by 24 hour trade volume per Epoch. The 24 hours top pairs snapshot looks something like this
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/6fb98b1bbc22be8b5aba8bdc860004d35786f4df/utils/models/message_models.py#L83-L93
```
**4. 7 days Top Pairs Snapshot:** Top pairs by 7 days trade volume per Epoch. The 7 days top pairs snapshot very similar to 24 hour top pairs snapshot but with a different time window.

**5. 24 hours Top Tokens Snapshot:** Top tokens by 24 hour trade volume per Epoch. The 24 hours top tokens snapshot looks something like this
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/6fb98b1bbc22be8b5aba8bdc860004d35786f4df/utils/models/message_models.py#L67-L80
```

** 6. 24 hours Stats Snapshot:** 24 hour stats of each pair per Epoch. The 24 hours stats snapshot looks something like this
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-computes/blob/6fb98b1bbc22be8b5aba8bdc860004d35786f4df/utils/models/message_models.py#L108-L115
```

### Implementation

The implementation of these processes is detailed in the [Closer Look at Snapshots](/docs/build-with-powerloom/use-cases/existing-implementations/uniswapv2-dashboard/closer-look-at-snapshots.md)


The specific configurations for data points like pair reserves, token prices, trading volumes, and fees are outlined in `config/projects.json` and `config/aggregator.json`. These configurations dictate what data to capture and how to process it. We have covered that in the [Fetching higher order datasets](/docs/build-with-powerloom/use-cases/existing-implementations/uniswapv2-dashboard/fetching-higher-order-datapoints).
