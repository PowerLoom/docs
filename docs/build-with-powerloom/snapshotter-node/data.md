# All about Data
So far we've talked a lot of verifiablity and decentralization of data. Let's dive into the details of how data is stored and how it can be verified and accessed.

## Data Storage
Data is stored in a decentralized manner using IPFS. IPFS is a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. It aims to replace HTTP and build a better web for all of us. IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. 

In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.

Every file and every block of data on the network has a unique hash associated with it. This hash is used to identify the data and is used to retrieve it from the network. This hash is called a CID (Content Identifier).

## Fetching CID and Verifying it On-Chain
![API Calls for the a certain CID](/images/uniswap-inspect.png)

Powerloom Uniswap V2 dashboard (https://uniswapv2.powerloom.io/) for example, connects to a snapshotter node hosted by the Powerloom Foundation. 
The frontend interacts with [Snapshotter Core API](/docs/category/snapshotter-core-api) to access the data. Internally, the Core API interacts with the Protocol State Contract deployed on Powerloom Prost chain to fetch the data.

### Verifying Data
To verify the data, all you need is Prost chain RPC Url and the address of the deployed protocol state contract. You can find these details in the `env.example` file in the Powerloom [deploy](https://github.com/PowerLoom/deploy/) repository.

#### Adding the Chain to the Wallet

Once you have these details:

1. Open MetaMask or any web3 plugin in your browser.
2. Go to the network selection area.
3. Choose to add a new network.
4. Enter the RPC URL and contract address you found in the `env.example` file.

This will allow you to connect to the Powerloom Prost chain. Metamask example is shown in the screenshot below.

Note: The RPC URL and the contract address in the screenshot below are just for reference. You need to use the ones from the `env.example` file.

#### Accessing the ABI of the protocol state Contract

To access and utilize the ABI of the protocol state contract from the Powerloom project, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Powerloom 'pooler' repository on GitHub at this URL: [Powerloom pooler repository - ProtocolContract.json](https://github.com/PowerLoom/pooler/blob/main/snapshotter/static/abis/ProtocolContract.json).
2. Locate the `ProtocolContract.json` file.
3. Copy the contents of the file.
4. Open the Remix IDE.
5. Create a new file with a `.abi` extension.
6. Paste the contents of the `ProtocolContract.json` file into this new file.
7. Save the file in Remix.

This process will allow you to have the protocol state contractâ€™s ABI available in the Remix editor for further development or interaction.

**Verifying datasets**

To verify data for any Project ID, follow these steps:

1. Identify the last finalized epoch associated with the project ID: For example, `aggregate_24h_top_pairs_lite:10ecae2f52160690abffff26efeb45568e5d67ea0bc7d4485d9ffb10ef437f33:UNISWAPV2`.
2. Retrieve the finalized CID (Content Identifier) for this epoch.
3. Access the dataset linked to this CID. You can do this either through your local IPFS node or by using a public IPFS gateway.(Public gateway link: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/{IPFS-CID})

The exact logic to retrieve the CID from the protocol state contract can easily be extracted from the [Snapshotter Core API](/docs/category/snapshotter-core-api) codebase.

Here's the code to find last finalized epoch for a project ID:
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/pooler/blob/d8b7be32ad329e8dcf0a7e5c1b27862894bc990a/snapshotter/core_api.py#L248-L339
```

Here's the code to fetch the data for a given epoch ID and project ID:
```python reference
https://github.com/PowerLoom/pooler/blob/d8b7be32ad329e8dcf0a7e5c1b27862894bc990a/snapshotter/core_api.py#L343-L404
```

All you need to do is call the relevant functions in the loaded Protocol state contract ABI in Remix IDE to fetch the data.


:::tip
Sometimes, the IPFS gateway can be overloaded or data might not be peer-to-peer replicated and it can result in not giving out an output. In that case, you can tunnel into your node and verify the data. 

```bash

```bash
ssh -nNTv -L 5001:127.0.0.1:5001 root@yourServerIP
```

```bash
ipfs cat bafkreifc33xiuqaf5nxqad2syn7j5x27j2pujzr7hhsxgtsr7zor4svqie --api /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001
```
