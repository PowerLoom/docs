# Introduction

Core API facilitates access to the finalized protocol state on the smart contract running on the anchor chain. Although it is possible to directly query the smart contract, it is not recommended as it is expensive and slow. Instead, you can use the Core API to access the finalized state. Every snapshotter node runs a Core API service that can be accessed by other services or applications.

We have hosted snapshotter nodes for UniswapV2 and Zkevm Quests on the Powerloom Protocol's testnet. You can interact with those endpoints directly from the next couple of sections.

## Hosted API

All the API endpoints are available for the given protocols.

ðŸ’¡ While the endpoints allow nominal usage for public access without an API key, we **do not** recommend them for developers. Doing so can severely restrict access to your IP address.
