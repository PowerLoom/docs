# Introduction

The Core API facilitates access to the finalized protocol state on the smart contract running on the anchor chain. Although it is possible to directly query the smart contract, it is not recommended due to its expense and slowness. Instead, you can use the Core API to access the finalized state. Every snapshotter node runs a Core API service that can be accessed by other services or applications.

We have hosted snapshotter nodes for UniswapV2 Powerloom Protocol's testnet. You can interact with those endpoints directly from the next couple of sections. 

NOTE: This endpoint might change later
