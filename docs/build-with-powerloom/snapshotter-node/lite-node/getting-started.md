<h3>Step 2: Accessing Your VPS </h3>

- **SSH into Your VPS**: Use the following command from your terminal/command prompt, replacing `your_vps_ip` with the IP address of your VPS.  

```bash
    ssh root@your_vps_ip
```

- If you set up SSH keys, you should be logged in without needing a password. Otherwise, you can also set your password for the VPS.

<h3>Step 3: Setting Up the Environment </h3>

1. **Update and Upgrade Your VPS**:

```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

2. **Install Python**:  
Ensure Python 3.11 is installed on your VPS. You can install Python by executing:

```bash 
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
```

1. **Install Git**:  
Git is necessary for cloning the Snapshotter Lite repository. Install it using:

```bash
    sudo apt-get install git -y
```

4. **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**   
Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. You can install docker on Ubuntu using the following commands:

```bash
    # Add Docker's official GPG key:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl 
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

    # Add the repository to Apt sources: 
    echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
```
    
Once the Docker repository is added successfully, letâ€™s install Docker and necessary components by using the below command:

```bash
