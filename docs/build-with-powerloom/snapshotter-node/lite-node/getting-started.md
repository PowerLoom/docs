# Setting Up and Running the Snapshotter Lite Node

:::tip Important Note!

ðŸ“¢ Please note that this setup is a simulation designed to let you experience and test the functionality of the snapshotter Node. It's important to note that the simulation setup will not yield any rewards.

However, once the testnet becomes operational on 12th February, 2024, you will have the opportunity to run the node and earn rewards.

:::

This section provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the Snapshotter Lite Node, including prerequisites and operational instructions.

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

The Snapshotter Lite Node is designed for minimal hardware demands, allowing it to operate effectively on various setups, including both local systems and cloud-based Virtual Machines.

  <TabItem value="linux-ubuntu" label="Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)" default>


- Clone this repository using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git clone -b simulation_mode https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-lite powerloom
```

- Change your working directory to the powerloom directory:

```bash
cd powerloom
```

- Run `build.sh` in the terminal to start the snapshotter lite node:

```bash
./build.sh
```

- During the setup, you'll be prompted to enter the following values:
  - `$SOURCE_RPC_URL`: Use any Ethereum Mainnet RPC, such as Ankr, Infura, or Alchemy.
  - `SIGNER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`: Utilize a burner wallet for the signer account address. Please DO NOT use your main/primary wallet. 
  - `SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`: Use the private key from your burner wallet.

:::tip
You can create a burner wallet by simply creating a new wallet on Metamask.
:::

- This should start your snapshotter node and you should see something like this in your terminal logs

```bash
snapshotter-lite_1  | 1|snapshotter-lite  | February 5, 2024 > 15:10:17 | INFO | Current block: 2208370| {'module': 'EventDetector'}

```

- To stop the node, you can press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the node is running or `docker-compose down` in a new terminal window from the project directory.

:::note
It is recommended to run build.sh in a screen or tmux session so that the process continues running even after you close the terminal.

Setting up the snapshotter node on Windows requires a few additional steps. We suggest using Docker for its ease and speed of setup. To begin with Docker, you must have the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed. Please follow the guide provided below for detailed instructions.

##### Initial Setup

- **Open PowerShell:** 
   - Start by opening PowerShell on your Windows machine. Search for `"PowerShell"` in the start menu and launch it.

- **Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):**
   - In the PowerShell window, enter the following command:
     ```bash
     wsl --install
     ```
   - This command installs the Windows Subsystem for Linux, necessary for running Docker.

- **Download and Install Docker:**
   - Download Docker from the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

- **Restart Your Computer:**
   - After installing Docker, restart your computer to apply all changes.

- **Open Docker:**
   - Post-restart, open Docker. This should automatically launch a Linux console.

- **Set Up Linux User Account:**
   - In the newly opened Linux console, set up a new user account by entering a username and password.

##### Granting Docker Permissions

- **Modify Docker Group Permissions:**
   - To grant Docker the necessary permissions, add your user to the Docker group with this command:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     ```
   - Logout and login again or restart the Docker service for the changes to take effect.

- **Verify Docker Installation:**
   - To confirm Docker is set up correctly, run:
     ```bash
     docker run hello-world
     ```
   - This command should display a message confirming Docker is functioning.

##### Cloning the Repository and Running the Build Script

- **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use the following command in WSL terminal to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone -b simulation_mode https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-lite powerloom
     ```

### Non-Docker Setup

<Tabs groupId="platform">
  <TabItem value="linux-ubuntu" label="Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)" default>
  
If you want to run the Snapshotter Lite Node without Docker, you need to make sure that you have Git, and Python version 3.10 or higher installed on your machine. We recommend using <b>python version 3.11.7</b>. You can find the installation instructions for your operating system on the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">official Python website</a>.

<details><summary> Optional: Installing Virtual Environment </summary>
For simplicity, we recommend using miniconda and setting up an environment with the needed python version as shown below
<p>

#### Install miniconda for your system:
   ```bash
   https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/
   ```
  
#### Verify the installation using the following command in your terminal
   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```

   Add miniconda to your path if the terminal does not identify conda as a valid command:
   ```bash
   export PATH="/Users/yourusername/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   Replace yourusername with your actual username

##### Create and activate a python environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n myenv python=3.11
   conda activate myenv
   ```
</p>
</details>

Once python3 is installed, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository using the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone -b simulation_mode https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-lite powerloom
   ```
    This will clone the repository into a directory named `powerloom`.
2. Change your working directory to the `powerloom` directory, open the terminal and type:

   ```bash
   cd powerloom
   ```
3. Run `init.sh` command in the terminal to start the snapshotter lite node:
   ```bash
   ./init.sh
   ```
4. During the setup, you'll be prompted to enter the following values:
  - `$SOURCE_RPC_URL`: Use any Ethereum Mainnet RPC, such as Ankr, Infura, or Alchemy.
  - `SIGNER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`: Utilize a burner wallet for the signer account address.
  - `SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`: Use the private key from your burner wallet.

This is a one-time configuration process that generates a .env file in the project's root directory.

The node setup will complete in approximately 2-3 minutes, after which the snapshotting process begins automatically.
