# Monitoring Node Status
This section will guide you through the process of Monitoring the status of your node's snapshotting process.

## Steps to Confirm and Monitor Node Snapshotting Process

1. **Terminal Status Check:**
   - The primary method to verify node status is through the terminal, which displays log responses from the node.

   - Monitor these logs to assess the health and activity of your node. 
   
   - A healthy snapshotter node will produce logs similar to the provided example screenshot. These logs indicate normal operation and successful snapshotting.

2. **Checking Dashboard for Snapshot Status:**
  
  To check the status of your snapshotter node, access your node dashboard. Once logged in, select the specific slot you wish to check. The snapshotter status will be indicated there. A status of '*complete*' in the **Current Day Status** signifies that the node is functioning correctly. Check the image below for reference:
