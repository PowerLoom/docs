<h3>Step 2: Accessing Your VPS </h3>

- **SSH into Your VPS**: Use the following command from your terminal/command prompt, replacing `your_vps_ip` with the IP address of your VPS.  

```bash
ssh root@your_vps_ip
```

- If you set up SSH keys, you should be logged in without needing a password. Otherwise, you can also set your password for the VPS.

<h3>Step 3: Setting Up the Environment </h3>

1. **Update and Upgrade Your VPS**:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

2. **Install Git**:  
Git is necessary for cloning the Snapshotter Lite repository. Install it using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git -y
```

3. **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**   
Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. You can install docker on Ubuntu using the following commands:

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl 
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources: 
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```
    
Once the Docker repository is added successfully, letâ€™s install Docker and necessary components by using the below command:

```

<h3>Step 4: Cloning the Repository and Setting Up the Node</h3>

1. **Clone the Snapshotter Lite Repository**:  
Navigate to the directory where you want to install the node and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-lite-v2.git powerloom-pre-mainnet-simulation
```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:  
Change to the directory of the cloned repository:

```bash
cd powerloom-pre-mainnet-simulation
```

<h3>Step 5: Running the Node </h3>

1. Setting up Screen:   
The Screen utility allows you to run processes in the background, enabling you to maintain long-running tasks without keeping a terminal window open. To initiate a new Screen session for managing the Snapshotter Lite Node V2, follow these steps:

Enter the following command to create a new Screen session named "powerloom":

```bash
screen -S powerloom-pre-mainnet-simulation
```
    
- This command opens a new Screen session, where you can start the Snapshotter Lite Node V2.
- Once inside the new Screen session, initiate the Snapshotter Lite Node V2 as required.
    
This approach ensures your node can continue running in the background, even if you disconnect from the terminal session.

2. **Initialize the Node**:  
Initiate the snapshotter lite node v2 setup by typing the command in the terminal:

```bash
./build.sh
```

  - [Vanity-ETH](https://vanity-eth.tk/)
  - [Powerloom Burner Wallet Generator](https://snapshotter-dashboard.powerloom.network/burner)

Once generated, make sure you assign your burner wallet on your [snapshotter dashboard](https://snapshotter-dashboard.powerloom.network/).
:::
    
**Environment Setup**:  
After initiating the process, the terminal will prompt you to enter the following information:

- During the setup, you'll be prompted to enter the following values:
  - `$SOURCE_RPC_URL`: Use any Ethereum Mainnet RPC, such as Ankr, Infura, or Alchemy.

  - `$SIGNER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`: Utilize a burner wallet for the signer account address. Please DO NOT use your main/primary wallet. 

  - `$SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`: Use the private key from your burner wallet.

  - `$SLOT_ID`: To assign your node to a specific slot, please provide the corresponding Slot ID or NFT ID. You can locate your NFT ID within your transaction details on PolygonScan.

After entering these details, the node will start running the background processes.

If you want to exit your screen, type the command in the terminal:


```bash  
CTRL+A+D
```

Ensure your node is running correctly, and check the logs for any errors or confirmations of successful operations. 


Everytime you restart the node, you should have a log message similar to the one shown below.

## Setting Up Multiple Nodes on a VPS

If you're looking to run multiple nodes, you can use our Multi-node setup python script. This section will guide you through setting up and managing multiple nodes.

### Clone the Multi-node setup script

First, clone our multi-node script to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PowerLoom/snapshotter-lite-multi-setup
cd snapshotter-lite-multi-setup
```

### Setting Up the Environment

It is imperative to create an isolated virtual environment that includes the necessary Python version and modules. This approach ensures that the global Python installations on the VPS or your local machine are not altered.

#### Installing `Pyenv`

Follow the steps below to install `pyenv` according to your OS. 
Open the terminal and execute the below commands.

<Tabs groupId="pyenv-installation" className="unique-tabs" queryString="pyenv-os">

<TabItem value="Linux" label="pyenv installation(Linux)">

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

After installing the packages, run the following command to execute the script for `pyenv` installation:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Next, add `pyenv` to the bashrc file:

```bash
cd
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Inside the `nano` editor, add the following lines at the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

To save changes in the `.bashrc` file, press `ctrl + o`. 

Refresh the terminal by typing:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Next, proceed to install Python 3.11.5:

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.5
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macOS" label="pyenv installation(MacOS)">

Install `pyenv` with the `brew` package manager. Ensure you run an update before the installation.

```bash
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

Next would be to add the right initializations into your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file depending upon whether you use the `bash` or `zsh` shell. If you use any other shell, consult its documentation to know where the similar profile `~/*rc` files are located.

The following example assumes a `~/.zshrc` file.

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Reload your shell profile in the terminal by running the command:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Next, proceed to install Python 3.11.5:

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.5
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

---

#### Installing `pyenv-virtualenv`

Execute the commands below to install `pyenv-virtualenv`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.5 ss_lite_multi_311
pyenv local ss_lite_multi_311
```


#### Executing the Setup

To establish a multi-node setup, follow these steps:

```bash
# Prepare the .env file
./init.sh
# Install all Python requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Execute the setup
python multi_clone.py
```
When you execute `python multi_clone.py`, you will see the following prompts that guide you through setting up your node(s).

1. **Terminate Existing containers:** "Do you want to kill all running containers and screen sessions of testnet nodes? (y/n) n"

- Type `y`. Use this option and stop all active containers or node instances. This will clean up all the older containers. Remember to cross-check your running containers before executing this command. 

2. **Custom Slot ID Deployment:** "Do you want to deploy a custom index of slot IDs (indices begin at 0, enter in the format [begin, end])? (indices/n)"

- For instance, to deploy the first four slot IDs as nodes, input `[0, 3]`, where 0 is the start index, and 3 represents the fourth element in the slot ID array associated with the wallet holder. If you want to deploy the entire array of slot IDs, type `n`.

3. **Deployment Batch Size:** " Enter the batch size into which you wish to split the deployment"

- A batch size of 1 means nodes will be deployed one by one, in batch size of 1. A batch size of 2 takes two nodes at a time and proceeds with deployment, and so on.

Following the setup prompts, the script will configure your node slots to run in separate screen sessions. To view the logs for a specific node slot, you can use the following commands:

To list all active screen sessions:
```bash
screen -ls
```
This command displays all currently running screen sessions.

![screen-command](/images/screen-command.png)

To attach to a specific node slot's screen session and check its status, use:
```bash
screen -r <screenId>
```
Note: Replace `<screenId>` with the actual ID of the screen session you wish to access.

To detach from the screen session and leave it running in the background, press `Ctrl + A` followed by `D`.
