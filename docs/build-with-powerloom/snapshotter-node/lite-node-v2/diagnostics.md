# Diagnostics and cleanup

The lite node as well as the multi node setup comes with a diagnostic and cleanup script. This script will check for any previous instances of the lite node, local collector, stale images and networks.

```bash
   ./diagnose.sh
```

The following output may vary depending on whether you have run snapshotter node(s) before this setup or not.

```
./diagnose.sh

## Cleanup[optional]

:::tip
This is particularly useful if you find your nodes are not running as expected and want a fresh start.
:::


### Stop and remove all powerloom containers


If the diagnostic script finds any running containers tagged with `snapshotter-lite`, it will ask you if you want to stop and remove them.

Select `y` at the following prompt and you see some logs like the following:

```
Would you like to stop and remove existing PowerLoom containers? (y/n): y 

Stopping running containers... (timeout: 30s per container)

### Remove all Docker subnets assigned to the snapshotter-lite containers

Enter `y` at the following prompt and you see some logs like the following:

```
Would you like to remove existing PowerLoom networks? (y/n): y

```

### Cleanup stale images and networks and cache

:::warning
This is a cleanup step that removes all stale images, networks and cache from Docker. Proceed only if all other attempts at running the node have failed after following our guides.
:::

Enter `y` at the following prompt and you see some logs like the following. Press `y` again at the end to confirm with Docker.

```
Would you like to remove unused Docker resources (only unused images, networks, and cache)? (y/n): y 

Removing unused Docker resources...

Running docker network prune...

Running docker system prune...
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all images without at least one container associated to them
  - all build cache

Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
