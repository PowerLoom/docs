# Powerloom Protocol

![Powerloom Workflow](/images/introduction.png)

PowerLoom is a decentralized data protocol built to serve the data needs of developers building web3 applications on smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Polygon, etc.

It enables a network of peers called "snapshotters" to reach consensus on observations of state transitions and event emissions across multiple smart contracts. 

:::tip
**Powerloom in nutshell**: PowerLoom is like a decentralized library catalog for blockchain data.

The "snapshotters" are like librarians who are continually observing shelves of books (smart contracts) and cataloging what books are added or removed, what pages change in existing books, and what notes readers add in book margins (events).
:::

The key benefits of PowerLoom for developers are:

**Decentralized Data:** Powerloom allows developers to build applications on top of decentralized, consensus-backed data instead of relying on centralized APIs. This improves reliability and transparency.

**Real-Time Data:** The snapshotter network provides real-time data updates as transactions occur on the blockchain, enabling applications that need live data.

**Time-series queries**: Storing the data history on IPFS enables queries over customizable time periods, not just current state. This is useful for analytics and tracking trends.

**Flexible Data Models:** Developers can define custom data schemas in "data markets" to track what's most valuable for their specific use case, beyond basic transactions.

**Modular and Extensible:** PowerLoom has a modular architecture that makes it easy for developers to add support for new data sources, transform data, and build on top of existing data pipelines.

## Getting Started

To begin using Powerloom Protocol, you need to understand the workflow and architecture of the system. This involves familiarizing yourself with the different components and how they interact within the protocol.

1. **Review Protocol Overview:** Start by reviewing the detailed Protocol Overview document. This document offers a comprehensive view of how the protocol functions.
2. **Explore the Pooler Implementation:** Visit the [Powerloom Pooler Section](/docs/Build-with-Powerloom/UniswapV2%20Dashboard/) to learn more about the Snapshotter implementation and its functionalities.

We also have a detailed Technical Community Update #1 Recording which walks through the details of the protocol:
