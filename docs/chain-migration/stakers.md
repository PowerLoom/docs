# Node Stakers

> ⚡️ TL;DR: No user action necessary! 

### The Powerloom network is migrating to a new chain between `Thu Mar 27 2025 06:00:00 - 09:00:00 GMT+0000`


Node stakers are *not* required to do any action. All data will be migrated to the new chain seamless. However, 24 hours before before migration, contracts will be paused. This means, any onchain actions such as new stake, withdrawals, claims, etc will be unavailable. Once the migration is complete, the contract will be resumed on the new chain with the same state as previous chain. The frontend will be automatically updated.
