### 🤨 What happens to my staked $POWER?

Your staked $POWER will be moved to the new chain seamlessly. Like we said, no user intervention is required.

### 🚦 What is impacted?

#### ⚠️ 24 hours before before migration, contracts will be paused. 

Following onchain actions related to the staking functionality will be unavailable

* new stake
* withdrawals
* claims 


#### ⏰ Once migration is complete 

* Staking contract will resume on the new chain with the same state as the previous chain. Which is to repeat our very first point from this page, no user action is necessary on your behalf and your stakes will be seamlessly be migrated to the new contract and chain.

* The frontend will be automatically updated with the same.
