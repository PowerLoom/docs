## Important Information

:::info Migration Timeline
Your staked tokens and rewards will be automatically migrated during the network upgrade. For the exact timeline of when staking operations will pause and resume, see the [Migration Timeline](/chain-migration/migration-timeline.md).
:::

### ü§® What happens to my staked $POWER?

Your staked $POWER will be moved to the new chain seamlessly. Like we said, no user intervention is required.

### üö¶ What is impacted?

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è 24 hours before before migration, contracts will be paused. 

Following onchain actions related to the staking functionality will be unavailable

* new stake
* withdrawals
* claims 


#### ‚è∞ Once migration is complete 

* Staking contract will resume on the new chain with the same state as the previous chain. To repeat the very first point, no user action is necessary on your behalf and your stakes will be seamlessly migrated to the new contract and chain.

* The frontend will be automatically updated with the same.
