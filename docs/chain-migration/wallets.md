# $POWER Holders

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Migrate your $POWER balance**  

:::info
⚡️ TL;DR: The Powerloom network is migrating to a new chain. Migration begins around `Thu Mar 27 2025 06:00:00 GMT+0000`!

If you hold $POWER on the old chain, you'll need to bridge it to the new chain.  
👉 If **all your $POWER is staked**, you **don't need to do anything** — it'll migrate automatically. See the [Node Stakers](/chain-migration/stakers.md) page for more details.

Check the [Migration Timeline](/chain-migration/migration-timeline) for further details.

### 🏗️ **How to Bridge**

4. **Confirm transaction** — Your wallet will request you to send $POWER.  
   - Leave a small amount for gas!

5. **Wait for bridging** — usually takes less than a minute.

:::tip
✅ Minting and staking will resume on the new chain after **March 27, 2025**.  

Stake on the old chain before then to maximize rewards!
