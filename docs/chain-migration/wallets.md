# POWER balance

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Balance needs to be migrated to new chain

### The Powerloom network is migrating to a new chain between `Thu Mar 27 2025 06:00:00 - 09:00:00 GMT+0000`

Users with $POWER balance on the older chain will need to use the following bridge to move the funds to the new chain. If you are [staking](https://mint.powerloom.network/staking) all of your balance, you *do not* need to anything. Steps to bridge to the new chain ðŸ‘‡

1. Go to: [migrate.powerloom.network](https://migrate.powerloom.network)

4. Your wallet will request you send POWER. Make sure to leave a tiny amount for gas!

5. Wait for bridging - usually takes less than a minute.

6. Once bridging is complete, you will see your balance on the [new chain](https://explorer-v2.powerloom.network/)!

> Please remember that minting/staking will resume on new chain after March 27th, 2025. So, it's best to [stake](https://mint.powerloom.network/staking) on the older before that and earn rewards!
