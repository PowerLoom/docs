# Snapshotter NFT Holders

> ⚡️ **TL;DR:** No user action necessary!

### 🚀 Powerloom is migrating to a new chain on **Thu, Mar 27, 2025, 06:00:00 - 09:00:00 GMT**  

Snapshotter NFT holders **don't need to do anything** — the migration will be seamless.  

### ✅ What's migrating:  
- Snapshotter NFTs  
- Unclaimed reward tokens  
- Burnt NFTs  
- Burner addresses for Snapshotter Nodes
- Vested tokens and everything else

### 🔒 Contract Pause Notice  
Contracts will be paused **24 hours before migration** (on **Wed, Mar 26, 2025, 06:00:00 - 09:00:00 GMT**).  
- No mints, claims, burns, or other onchain actions during this time.  
- Everything will resume smoothly on the new chain once the migration is complete — frontend and all.
